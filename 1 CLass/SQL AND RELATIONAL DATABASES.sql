---### 1. Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases

/*#### **What is a Relational Database?**
A relational database organizes data into **tables** (also called relations), where each table contains **rows** (records) and **columns** (attributes). 
The tables are related through specific columns, called **keys**, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Relational databases are based on
the **relational model**, proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970, and are designed to ensure data integrity, consistency, and scalability.*/

/*- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Data is stored in structured tables with predefined schemas.
  - Relationships between tables are established using keys (primary and foreign keys).
  - Supports **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for reliable transactions.
  - Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.*/

/*#### **What is SQL?**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to define, manipulate, and query data.*/

/**SQL Functions**:
  - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Define and modify database structures (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`).
  - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Insert, update, delete, and retrieve data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`).
  - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Manage access and permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).
  - **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: Manage transactions (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).*/

-- **Example**:
  
  -- Create a table
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100)
  );
  -- Insert data
  INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email) 
  VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
  -- Query data
  SELECT * FROM customers;
  

/*#### **Why Use Relational Databases and SQL?**
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints).
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets with indexing and optimization.
- **Flexibility**: SQL queries allow complex data retrieval and analysis.
- **Standardization**: SQL is widely supported across database systems.*/

/*### 2. Information and Data Models

#### **What is a Data Model?**
A data model is a conceptual framework that defines how data is organized, stored, and accessed in a database. It provides a blueprint for structuring data and relationships.

#### **Types of Data Models**
1. **Conceptual Data Model**:
   - High-level representation of data entities and their relationships.
   - Used during the planning phase, often visualized with **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**.
   - Example: A library system with entities like "Book," "Author," and "Borrower."

2. **Logical Data Model**:
   - Translates the conceptual model into a database-specific structure (e.g., relational tables).
   - Defines tables, columns, keys, and relationships without physical storage details.
   - Example: Mapping the "Book" entity to a table with columns like `book_id`, `title`, `author_id`.

3. **Physical Data Model**:
   - Specifies how data is stored on disk, including indexes, partitions, and storage configurations.
   - Example: Defining a table with specific data types (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`) and indexing strategies.

#### **Relational Data Model**
The relational data model is the foundation of relational databases:
- Data is organized into **tables**.
- Each table represents an **entity** (e.g., "Customer").
- Columns represent **attributes** (e.g., `name`, `email`).
- Rows represent **instances** of the entity (e.g., a specific customer).
- Relationships are defined using **keys**.

#### **Example ERD**:
For a simple online store:
- Entities: Customer, Order, Product.
- Relationships: A Customer places Orders; an Order contains Products.
- ERD components:
  - Rectangles: Entities (Customer, Order, Product).
  - Diamonds: Relationships (places, contains).
  - Attributes: `customer_id`, `order_id`, `product_name`.*/

/*### 3. Types of Relationships

Relationships define how entities (tables) are connected in a relational database. They are implemented using **primary keys** 
(unique identifiers) and **foreign keys** (references to primary keys in another table). There are three main types of relationships:

#### **1. One-to-One (1:1)**
- Each record in Table A is related to exactly one record in Table B, and vice versa.
- Example: A Person has one Passport.
- Implementation:*/
  
  CREATE TABLE persons (
      person_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100)
  );
  CREATE TABLE passports (
      passport_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      person_id INT UNIQUE,  -- Ensures 1:1
      passport_number VARCHAR(20),
      FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES persons(person_id)
  );
  

/*#### **2. One-to-Many (1:N)**
- One record in Table A can be related to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B relates to only one record in Table A.
- Most common relationship type.
- Example: A Customer places multiple Orders.
- Implementation:*/
  
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100)
  );
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
  );
 

/*#### **3. Many-to-Many (M:N)**
- Multiple records in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B.
- Requires a **junction table** (or associative table) to store relationships.
- Example: Students enroll in multiple Courses, and Courses have multiple Students.
- Implementation:*/

  CREATE TABLE students (
      student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100)
  );
  CREATE TABLE courses (
      course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      course_name VARCHAR(100)
  );
  CREATE TABLE enrollments (
      student_id INT,
      course_id INT,
      enrollment_date DATE,
      PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
      FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
      FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
  );
  ```

#### **Relationship Constraints**
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure referential integrity (e.g., no order can reference a non-existent customer).
- **Cascading Actions**:
  - `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Deletes related records (e.g., delete orders when a customer is deleted).
  - `ON UPDATE CASCADE`: Updates foreign keys when the primary key changes.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
    ```

### 4. Mapping Entities to Tables

Mapping entities to tables involves translating a conceptual or logical data model into a relational database schema. This process ensures that entities, attributes, and relationships are properly represented as tables, columns, and keys.

#### **Steps for Mapping**
1. **Map Entities to Tables**:
   - Each entity becomes a table.
   - Example: Entity "Employee" becomes:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100),
         hire_date DATE
     );
     ```

2. **Map Attributes to Columns**:
   - Each attribute of the entity becomes a column with an appropriate data type.
   - Example: Entity "Product" with attributes `product_id`, `name`, `price`:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE products (
         product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100),
         price DECIMAL(10, 2)
     );
     ```

3. **Map Relationships**:
   - **One-to-One**: Add a foreign key in one table with a `UNIQUE` constraint.
   - **One-to-Many**: Add a foreign key in the "many" table referencing the "one" table.
   - **Many-to-Many**: Create a junction table with foreign keys to both tables.
   - Example (One-to-Many): Department and Employee:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE departments (
         department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100)
     );
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100),
         department_id INT,
         FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
     );
     ```

4. **Add Constraints**:
   - **Primary Key**: Ensures uniqueness and identifies each record.
   - **Foreign Key**: Enforces relationships.
   - **Unique**: Prevents duplicate values in specific columns (e.g., email).
   - **Not Null**: Ensures a column cannot be empty.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE customers (
         customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );
     ```

5. **Normalize the Schema** (optional):
   - Apply normalization rules to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity (see Relational Model Concepts below).

#### **Example: Mapping an ERD**
- **Entities**: Customer, Order.
- **Attributes**:
  - Customer: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`.
  - Order: `order_id`, `order_date`, `amount`.
- **Relationship**: One-to-Many (Customer places Orders).
- **Mapped Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
  );
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
  );
  ```

/*### 5. Relational Model Concepts

The relational model is the theoretical foundation of relational databases, defining how data is structured and manipulated. Below are key concepts:

#### **1. Tables (Relations)**
- A table is a collection of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
- Each table represents an entity or relationship.
- Example: A `customers` table with columns `customer_id`, `name`, `email`.

#### **2. Keys**
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row in a table (e.g., `customer_id`).
  - Must be unique and non-null.
- **Foreign Key**: A column that references the primary key of another table to establish a relationship.
  - Example: `customer_id` in the `orders` table references `customers.customer_id`.
- **Candidate Key**: Any column (or set of columns) that could serve as a primary key.
- **Composite Key**: A primary key made of multiple columns (e.g., `student_id` + `course_id` in `enrollments`).

#### **3. Normalization**
Normalization organizes data to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. It involves dividing tables into smaller, related tables based on **normal forms**:
- **First Normal Form (1NF)**:
  - Eliminate repeating groups; ensure atomic values.
  - Example: Split a column with multiple phone numbers into a separate table.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:
  - Must be in 1NF; eliminate partial dependencies (non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key).
  - Example: Move `customer_name` from `orders` to `customers` if `order_id` + `customer_id` is the key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
  - Must be in 2NF; eliminate transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes).
  - Example: Move `department_name` to a `departments` table if it depends on `department_id`.*/

- **Example**:
  Unnormalized table:
  ```
  orders(order_id, customer_id, customer_name, customer_email, order_date)
  ```
  Normalized:
  
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100)
  );
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
  );
  

/*#### **4. Integrity Constraints**
- **Entity Integrity**: Primary keys must be unique and non-null.
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key values must match an existing primary key or be null.
- **Domain Integrity**: Values in a column must conform to the defined data type or constraints (e.g., `price >= 0`).
- Example:*/
  
  CREATE TABLE products (
      product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price >= 0)
  );
  ```

/*#### **5. Relational Algebra**
- The theoretical basis for SQL queries, consisting of operations like:
  - **Selection**: Filter rows (e.g., `WHERE`).
  - **Projection**: Select columns (e.g., `SELECT`).
  - **Join**: Combine tables based on conditions.
  - **Union**: Combine results of two queries.
- Example: A SQL query like `SELECT name FROM customers WHERE age > 30` maps to relational algebra operations (selection and projection).

#### **6. Schema and Instances**
- **Schema**: The structure of the database (tables, columns, constraints).
- **Instance**: The actual data in the tables at a given time.
- Example: The `customers` table schema defines `customer_id`, `name`, `email`; an instance is the current rows (e.g., "Alice", "Bob").*/

### Practical Example

**Scenario**: Design a database for a library system.
- **Entities**: Book, Author, Borrower.
- **Relationships**:
  - An Author writes multiple Books (1:N).
  - A Borrower borrows multiple Books (M:N).

- **Schema**:
  
  -- Authors table
  CREATE TABLE authors (
      author_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  );
  -- Books table
  CREATE TABLE books (
      book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
      author_id INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id)
  );
  -- Borrowers table
  CREATE TABLE borrowers (
      borrower_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  );
  -- Junction table for M:N relationship
  CREATE TABLE loans (
      borrower_id INT,
      book_id INT,
      loan_date DATE,
      PRIMARY KEY (borrower_id, book_id),
      FOREIGN KEY (borrower_id) REFERENCES borrowers(borrower_id),
      FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id)
  );
  
-- **Sample Query**:
  
  SELECT b.title, a.name AS author
  FROM books b
  JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id
  WHERE b.book_id IN (
      SELECT book_id
      FROM loans
      WHERE borrower_id = 1
  );
  
  --Retrieves books borrowed by a specific borrower, joining with the author’s name.

/*### Database-Specific Notes
- **PostgreSQL**: Strong support for constraints, JSON data, and advanced indexing.
- **MySQL**: Simpler for small-scale applications but limited in advanced features like full outer joins.
- **SQL Server**: Robust for enterprise use, with strong integration with Microsoft tools.
- **Oracle**: Highly scalable, with advanced features like partitioning and PL/SQL.*/
