    "To apply logistic regression to stock data for trading, weâ€™ll need to modify the code to include relevant stock features like historical prices, indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), and target values based on price direction (up/down). Here's a simple implementation using stock data from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library.\n",

    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**: First, you'll need the required libraries.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Data Download**: We're using `yfinance` to download historical stock data for Apple (AAPL).\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: A simple 20-day moving average.\n",
    "   - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: A 20-day EMA.\n",
    "   - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Used to measure the speed and change of price movements (typically used to spot overbought or oversold conditions).\n",
    "3. **Target**: We set the target variable as `1` (price goes up) or `0` (price goes down) based on whether the next day's closing price is higher than the current day's closing price.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: We train a logistic regression model on the above features and evaluate it with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- This is a simplified model. You can improve it by adding more features, fine-tuning the model, or using more advanced machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- The target variable is a binary classification (price up or down), so this model could be used to make buy/sell decisions based on predicted price direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to customize the model or further explore its performance!"
